# Events-app

Event-app is a simple web application that lists and manages events.

## Usage

Before you begin cloning make sure your computer has [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and [Node](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm#using-a-node-version-manager-to-install-nodejs-and-npm) installed.

To clone the repo locally onto your computer, open the terminal then type in:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/helenyau0/event-app.git
# downloads the project
$ cd event-app
# navigates into project folder
$ npm install
# installs all packages for project
```

Next find or create a .env file in the root folder of the project then set REACT_APP_URL=base url and REACT_APP_API_KEY=authorization token then save.

Then finally you can start your server by typing in the terminal:

```bash
$ npm start
# starts server on localhost:3000
```

Now the app should be up and ready to go!
